/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for CyberShelf.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-specific data
 * (e.g., user profiles, cart items). Public data (e.g., ebooks, services) is
 * readable by all, but writable only by authorized users (currently unrestricted in this prototyping phase).
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information. Access is restricted to the owning user.
 * - /ebooks/{ebookId}: Stores ebook details. Read access is public, write access is restricted.
 * - /services/{serviceId}: Stores service details. Read access is public, write access is restricted.
 * - /contact_requests/{contactRequestId}: Stores contact requests. Access is restricted.
 * - /users/{userId}/cart_items/{cartItemId}: Stores cart items. Access is restricted to the owning user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Ebooks and services are publicly readable.
 * - Schema validation is relaxed in this prototyping phase to allow for rapid iteration.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  N/A - No denormalization is used in this ruleset. More complex role-based access
 *  control would benefit from denormalizing roles directly onto secured documents.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  The ruleset uses structural segregation for user-specific data (profiles and cart items).
 *  Private data is stored under the /users/{userId} collection, while public data is stored in top-level collections.
